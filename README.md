# Discord Bot That Filters Profanity 
This bot utilizes regex rather than neural-based Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MNkp8vCZ8zUYGCEMJW-_dn6pTFFOsdPhoWIrudeP1v4/edit?usp=sharing) is a research paper I wrote about the topic (non-professional work).

[Here](https://youtu.be/3u8xdN3v22I) is a bot demo (outdated). 

# Word Lists
Both the default blacklist and whitelist can be found [here](https://github.com/senseibence/discord-profanity-bot/blob/main/Profanity-Filtering%20Discord%20Bot/profanityList.js).

Changes made to the lists by individual servers are not reflected here.
