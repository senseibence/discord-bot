# Discord Bot That Filters Profanity 
This bot utilizes regex rather than neural-based Natural Language Processing (NLP). [Here](https://youtu.be/3u8xdN3v22I) is a demo (outdated).

# Changes
* Add "molasses" to the word whitelist
* Smoother handling of character limit in stats command embedded message
* Make regex algorithm less aggressive
* App password

# Verification
Once the bot is in 75 servers, I will apply for [discord bot verification](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412-Bot-Verification-and-Data-Whitelisting). This would be a big milestone, and each week the bot comes closer to that goal.
